print(14 + 10)  # This code works correctly by adding the two numbers
print(14 + 10)  # This code needed to be fixed by removing quotes to make it add the numbers
print("14 + 10")  # This code works by printing the addition problem
print("14" + "10")  # This code works by putting the two numbers beside each other
print("Hello World")  # The code was missing a double quote, it prints a string
print("Hello World")  # This code used single quote rather than double quotes and also prints a string
print("Hello World")  # This code was missing quotes, it also prints a string
print("Hello World")  # This code worked fine and was not missing anything to print a string.
print(True + False)  # This code prints 1 successfully
