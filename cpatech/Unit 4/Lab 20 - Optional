Hex Grid
Design a program that will create a hexagon tessellation on your output screen. Avoid creating large strings that you repeat - your code should allow you to change the width and height of total output. The width and height values can be hardcoded or user input.

You will need to use nested loops for this project.

Review Google Classroom for the target output.

BONUS: For +1 bonus point, design your program so that it has a hexSize variable. This variable should control the side length for your hexagons. The sample shown on Google Classroom is hexSize = 1. To give you an idea, the output with hexSize = 3 should use 3 underscores as the top and bottom and 3 slashes to make up each diagonal.
