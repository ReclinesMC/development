Deep Cave
Design a simple ASCII animation that looks like an unending cave. Define a screen with and a cave width. Your program should continuously display the next level of the cave - each level may be slightly modified from the last. You may use an infinite while loop for this project.

See Google Classroom for a screenshot of the potential output. Keep in mind that the lines of code should continue indefinitely and that your cave should never go off screen.
